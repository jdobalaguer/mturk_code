<h2>Learning and decision making</h2>
<h3>Information for participants</h3>

<p>Thank you for being willing to participate in our experiment.  Your 
contribution to our research is very valuable and we appreciate your 
help.</p>

<h4>What are these experiments about?</h4>
<p>We are interested in understanding how people make decisions.  In 
particular, we are interested in how people use knowledge that they have
 gained from past experience and how they apply it to new situations.</p>

<h4>Who is conducting these experiments?</h4>
<p>The experiments are being conducted by Dr Christopher Summerfield of 
the University of Oxford, England, and his postdoctoral and postgraduate
 staff: Dr Steven Buckingham (postdoctoral researcher), Dr Sam Cheadle 
(postdoctoral researcher), Dr Alejo Nevado (postdoctoral researcher), Dr
 Konstantinos Tsetsos (postdoctoral researcher), Mr Jan Balaguer
 (research assistant) and Ms Elizabeth Michael (research student).  The 
team can be contacted by e-mail on neuronoodle@gmail.com .</p>

<h4>What if I have a question?</h4>
<p>We welcome questions about the project.  If you have any questions, please email Dr Summerfield on neuronoodle@gmail.com .</p>

<h4>What will we ask you to do?</h4>
<p>You will read some instructions before starting the experiment. We will also give you a reminder of what to do when the experiment starts.</p>

<h4>Will these experiments reveal anything about my personality?</h4>
<p>No.  The data we get from you will be pooled with the data from other
 participants.  That is because we are looking for trends that only 
emerge when a lot of data are analyzed.  In any case, we can't infer 
anything about your individual personality from these data.</p>

<h4>How will my data be used?</h4>
<p>All we are recording is where you click on the screen and at what 
time relative to the start of the experiment.  We collect no other data 
than that.  When you get to the end of the experiment, you will be asked
 if you are happy to send the data to our server.  The data will be 
pooled with those of many other participants.  We will then use the 
pooled data to test our theories about learning and decision making.  
Because of the way data are aggregated, once your data has been 
submitted we are not able to remove it.  The data will be stored on 
computers located within the University of Oxford network and only the 
members of the Summerfield laboratory stated above have access to your 
data.  At the end of the project the data will be archived in case a 
query about the research arises after the results of the project are 
analysed and published.  We record none of your personal data.</p>

<h4>What are the risks and benefits of the research?</h4>
<p>There are no risks associated with the research.  If successful, the 
project will hopefully result in a paper being published, so that other 
scientists can build on our work.  In other words, it will help everyone
 understand better how people learn and make decisions.  </p>

<h4>What should I do if I have a complaint?</h4>
<p>This project has been reviewed by, and received ethics clearance 
through, the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics 
Committee.  If you have a concern about any aspect of this project, 
please speak to the researcher concerned (neuronoodle@gmail.com) who will do
 his/her best to answer your query. If you remain unhappy and wish to 
make a formal complaint, please contact Research Ethics Committee at the
 University of Oxford (ethics@medsci.ox.ac.uk; Medical Sciences 
Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee, Medical Sciences Divisional 
Office, Level 3 John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK </p>

<h4>What if I don't like the experiment once I have started?</h4>
<p>You can stop any time just by closing the program.  No data will be 
sent -
that only happens once you have finished the task and pressed a button 
on the screen to indicate that you are happy about the data being sent.</p>

<h4>How long does the experiment take?</h4>
<p>The whole experiment takes about 50min once you have started.</p>
