<h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
<p>
  For each pair of shapes, try to guess the button (left / right) that gives correct feedback.<br>
  It might be based on any or both of the shapes - pay attention to the angle or the length!<br>
  Respond using the LEFT and the RIGHT arrow keys in your keyboard.<br>
  You will get a CORRECT/INCORRECT feedback on every trial.<br>
  You will be guessing at first, but your brain will kick in over time.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The experiment should take about 50 - 60 min
